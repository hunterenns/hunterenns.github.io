      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h6>May 23, 2022</h6>
      <p>Welcome! This is my personal website where I plan to post some of the projects I have worked on during and after university. Please keep in mind that this is a work in progress. <br></p>
      <p>In 2018, I started attending Ryerson University (now known as Toronto Metropolitan University) for mechanical engineering. After my first two years, I opted to specialize in mechatronics engineering.
      Last month I graduated from this program with a Bachelor of Engineering.<br></p>
